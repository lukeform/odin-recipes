            <li>4 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>    
            <li>4 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
        </ul>
    </P>
    
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p><strong>STEP 1</strong>Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and season the beef all over. 
        Heat 1 tbsp oil in a flameproof casserole over a medium-high heat and brown the beef until dark, about 15 mins, in batches if you need to, using 
        1 tbsp oil for each batch. 
        Drain the beef in a colander to remove the fat while you cook the rest.</p>

    <P><strong>STEP 2</strong>Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper, then add about 2 tbsp oil, the onions, carrots, celery and garlic with a pinch of salt and
         cook for 8-10 mins over a low-medium heat. Stir in the tomato pur√©e and cook for a further 3 mins. Add the wine, herbs, tomatoes and stock, season 
         and bring to the boil, stir the beef back into the sauce and reduce to a simmer. Cover and put in the oven for 2 hrs 30 mins, then remove the lid, 
         stir and put back in the oven, uncovered, for 30 mins.
         Stir or use a fork to roughly shred the beef, and season. Serve now, or chill until serving, it tastes better if made a day ahead.</p>

    <P><strong>STEP 3</strong>When ready to serve, gently reheat the ragout over a medium heat. 
        Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water for 3 mins, drain then tip into the ragout, toss together with some of the parmesan and leave for 1 min.
         Ladle the pasta into bowls, scatter over the remaining parmesan and serve.</p>
